					<p class = "quote_one">I went to an Acupuncture Clinic to undergo acupuncture treatment.  
					I had been trying for years to get rid of the TBI headache pain that
					I was suffering from, but to no avail.  I have to say that I am very 
					happy with the results.  My headaches have really improved and I am 
					feeling much better.</p>
					<div class = "close_quotation"></div>
					<div class = "open_quotation_two"></div>
					<p class = "quote_two">I have been receiving acupuncture for a little 
					over a month for anxiety.  The treatments have made a huge difference 
					in my breathing, the quality of my sleep and my overall balance.  When
					 I leave, I feel blessed with good energy in my mind, body and soul</p>
					 <div class = "close_quotation_two"></div>
					 <div class = "open_quotation"></div>
					 <p class = quote_one>Working as an Army Nurse at Walter Reed could be
					  a high stress with working long hours and taking care of very sick 
					  and wounded patients, including many amputees and multi trauma patients
					   from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It was very nice to have a 
					   group of people who specialized in alternate therapies who gave treatments 
					   in acupuncture, acupressure, zero balancing and massage therapy come 
					   to the hospital every week for several reasons.  As a caregiver you can give
					   a lot oneself to your patients, and it was nice to have people come to
					   care for you, who showed genuine interest in your health and wellbeing.
					   The clinicians who did the alternate therapies were interested in 
					   the whole being to include relieving stress as well as physical pain.  
					   It was very helpful for relaxation and stress relief.  It was a quiet 
					   and peaceful place where you can take a break from your busy day and 
					   work and refocus your energy.  By having this experience you could 
					   go back to your patients and take better care of them.</p>
					   <div class = "close_quotation"></div>
					   <div class = "open_quotation_two"></div>
					<p class = "quote_two">Also it was nice because it offered several 
					options for relaxation and healing therapy to include acupuncture, 
					acupressure, zero balancing and massage. No matter which therapy 
					(or therapies because you could get more than one in a session) you had 
					you felt feeling relaxed and with much less stress.  This feeling of 
					relaxation lasted throughout the day, or even for several days, and let 
					to things like better sleep and better mood.</p>
